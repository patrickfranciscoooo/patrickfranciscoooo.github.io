            Hello, I am Patrick John A. Francisco. You can call me Pat or Patrick, any of the two will do.<br><br>

            My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 130 because I enjoyed it a lot last semester when I took it. Its topic was interesting
            because of the illustrations, diagrams and the program we used, Multimedia Logic, to better understand the lesson
            and answer the requirements about logic circuit, logic gates and the like.<br><br>

            My favorite GE so far is Ethics 1 because it challenged and honed my thinking and reasoning skills about a certain topic
            that is really timely. It will make you think if a specific decision to be made in a given situation is the one that you should
            do or the other way around in a way that you will weigh which is which.<br><br>

            My favorite PL or Programming Language so far is Python because of how easily it is to understand. The way we get the values stored
            in a variable is more convenient or easier to do than in C programming language wherein you have to know the type of the value stored
            in the variable. I really enjoyed using this programming last semester because of the ease in using it in the programs we did. The way
            we code using this language was like telling a story or explaining how we explain in the English language. <br><br>

            My favorite food is Milktea. I really love Milktea most especially the ones with cream cheese or "cheesecake" in their flavor.
            It serves as my comfort food and a reward to myself for having a great day.
